##  An Improved I Chart

### A webinar on simplifying statistical process control with I-prime charts  

In this webinar, we introduce the I-prime (I') chart – a new statistical process control (SPC) tool that retains the simplicity of the I chart while addressing its limitations. It handles both measurement and count data, adapts to varying subgroup sizes, and holds the potential to replace other common SPC charts.

### Target audience

The webinar is intended for analysts and practitioners involved in healthcare quality control and improvement. Prior experience with SPC methodology and programming in R will be beneficial.

### Aims

The webinar is scheduled to run for 60 minutes. After attending, you will:

* understand the theory behind I' charts,
* know when – and when not – to use I' charts as alternatives to traditional SPC charts, and
* be able to construct I' charts using R.

### Preparations and materials

No preparation is required to participate in the webinar. However, if you would like to refresh your understanding of basic SPC theory and practice, we recommend browsing Part 1 of our work-in-progress book:

* Anhøj & Mohammed (2025): [Mastering Statistical Process Control Charts in Healthcare](https://anhoej.github.io/spc4hc/). A book under development.  

If you want a head start on the theory behind I' charts, we recommend reading Taylor's original paper:

* Taylor (2018): [Normalized Individuals Control Chart](https://variation.com/normalized-individuals-control-chart/). The original article introducing I' charts.

Also, you may wish to install and familiarise yourself with pbcharts, an R package currently in development:

* Anhøj (2025): [Process Behaviour Charts](https://github.com/anhoej/pbcharts). Yet another R package for making SPC charts:

```
devtools::install_github("anhoej/pbcharts")
```
