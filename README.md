# One Chart to Rule Them All

Simplifying statistical process control with I-prime charts  

In this webinar we introduce the I-prime (I') chart, a new statistical process control (SPC) tool that retains the intuitive simplicity and interpretability of the I chart while addressing its key limitations. Designed to accommodate both measurement and count data, the I' chart adapts gracefully to varying subgroup sizes, offering a more accurate and nuanced picture of process variation.

The webinar is intended for analysts and practitioners involved in healthcare quality control and improvement. Prior experience with SPC methodology and programming in R will be beneficial.
