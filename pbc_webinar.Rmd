## Programme

1. Back to basics: Statistical process control in a nutshell

1. Introducing the I' chart

1. I' charts with [pbcharts](https://github.com/anhoej/pbcharts) for R

1. Questions and discussion

After attending, you will:

* understand the theory behind I' charts,

* know when – and when not – to use I' charts as alternatives to traditional SPC charts, and

* be able to construct I' charts using R.

## The standard control chart

```{r}
set.seed(2222222)
pbc(rnorm(24), chart = 'i', cl = 0, sd = 1,
    ylab = 'Standard deviation',
    xlab = 'Subgroups',
    title = NULL)
```

## Understanding variation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Common Cause Variation                    Special Cause Variation
----------------------------------------  --------------------------------------
Also referred to as random                Also referred to as non-random
variation or noise.                       variation or signal.

Is caused by a stable process and is      Is caused by an assignable cause that
intrinsic to the process.                 it extrinsic to the process.

                                          premediated  or incidental.

                                          can be adapted into a new process.

## A special cause

```{r}
pbc(bp,
    chart = 'i',
    title = 'Systolic blood pressure',
    ylab = 'mm Hg',
    xlab = 'Day')
```

## Control chart conundrum

<div style='font-size: smaller;'>

$\text{control limits} = CL \pm 3SD$, SD = within subgroup standard deviation

```{r limits-tab1, echo=FALSE}
read.delim('input/limit_formulas.tsv', check.names = F) |> 
  kbl() |> 
  pack_rows('Count data', 1, 3) |> 
  pack_rows('Measurement data', 4, 7) |> 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "condensed", font_size = 18)
```

</div>

Not to mention P' and U' charts for proportions and rates with large denominators.

## The I chart: The Swiss Army Knife of SPC

::: rfloat
![](input/sak.jpg)
:::

* Originally designed for individual measurements.

* Uses the average moving range as a proxy for the *empirical* within subgroup variation.

* Also works for count data and aggregated measurements.

* Robust with minimal reliance on specific distributional assumptions.

* Recommended by some as the only chart you need.

* *However*, does not accommodate varying subgroup sizes.

*Introducing the I' chart!*

## Calculating control limits for the I' chart

<hr>
---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------
Values to plot:                          $y = \frac{n}{d}$
Centre line:                             $\bar{y} = \frac{\sum{n}}{\sum{d}}$
Standard deviation of i^th^ data point:  $s_i = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\vert{}y_i-y_{i-1}\vert{}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{d_i}+\frac{1}{d_{i-1}}}}$
Average standard deviation:              $\bar{s} = \frac{\sum{s}}{o}$
Control limits:                          $\text{CL} = \bar{y} \pm 3 \frac{\bar{s}}{\sqrt{d_i}}$
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: aside
n = numerators, d = denominators, o = number of data values, i = i^th^ data value

## Introducing pbcharts

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('anhoej/pbcharts')
library(pbcharts)

```

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3.8, fig.width=7.6}
pbc(bp, chart = 'i', title = 'Systolic blood pressure', ylab = 'mm Hg', xlab = 'Day')
```
